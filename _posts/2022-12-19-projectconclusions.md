## Analysis Conclusions

The primary question evaluated by these analyses was if there was a statistically significant association between average air pollution and average lifespan within the United States as evaluated by state.  After analysis of five linear regression models, the generalized additive model was identified as the best model to evaluate the relationship between lifespan and air pollution across the United States. Overall, a significant association (P<0.05) was observed (P=2.31 x 10-4) in addition to covariates drinking, smoking and lead exposure as conferring statistically significant increased risk of decreasing average lifespan. Although the data met the general assumptions of the linear model, the generalized additive model permitted flexibility with respect to the linear relationship between air pollution and lifespan, as noted by the weak R value and thus it was not surprising the additive model outperformed the models considered.

## Limitations
* Reliance on 2010 Census data, which may no longer be representative of current air pollution and life span across U.S. States
* Missing variables and complex outcome - lifespan impacted by numerous variables not accounted for: racial disparities, access to healthcare, employment etc. 
* Variability in health data reported by state and city

## Future Scope
* Repeat analysis incorporating additional health attributes
* Conduct analysis on a state specific level
